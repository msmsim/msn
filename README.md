Hi, I’m Matt. A writer turned product manager; a self-taught programmer; an autodidact. I'm especially interested in the intersection of complex systems, computing and communication. My latest [annual review-roundup-reflection](https://swellandcut.com/sotw-2022) provides some more context.

## Contact

The simplest way to reach me is email: _matt@thisdomain_. I use email for correspondence, instead of capture. I’m [responsive by default](https://swellandcut.com/sotw-2022/#community) and I operate by [Crocker’s Rules](http://sl4.org/crocker.html). You can also reach me on [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/)(as @msms), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Matthew_Sweet) (as @Matthew_Sweet), and via a dynamic set of Discord servers and Slack groups.
